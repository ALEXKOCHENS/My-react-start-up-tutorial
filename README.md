## About

This project is a _React starter template_ to begin building UI features without clutter or unnecessary default content. It’s perfect for learning React basics, experimenting with components, and structuring your first front‑end app.

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the app on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StackKens/My-react-start-up.git
cd My-react-start-up
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start a local server and open your app at `http://localhost:3000/`.
